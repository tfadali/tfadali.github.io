        <h1>Linear Algebra</h1>
        <p>
            This will be the first of a series of posts on linear algebra from a geometrical point of view
            with applications to computer graphics. The only prequisite will be some familiarity with vectors
            and complex numbers.  There are a lot of applications of linear algebra, but graphics were chosen
            because of the closeness to the visual ideas that I want to explain here. We will focus only on
            linear algebra in two or three dimensions and develop as much of the subject as we can in that
            setting first.  Be aware, though, that a lot of the power of linear algebra comes when we generalize
            to n dimensions.

                about it.  We are going to reinvent it.

            We will begin with a practical problem.  Let's say we are going to write a CAD program or a computer
            game where we need to display some 3-dimensional objects.  Also, let's suppose we want to lengths to
            be displayed to scale, rather getting smaller as they recede in the distance.  Imagine Sim City or a
            top-down game that takes place mostly close to a flat plane or some architectural design where a 10m
            line in real life always needs to be represented by a 10cm line in the program.  We will not try to
            build a production-grade product, but instead just try to solve the meat of the problem, so that we will
            be forced to develop all the necessary mathematics.  We will lean towards "reinventing the wheel" because
            our goal is understanding how this sort of program might work from first-principles, rather than creating a
            functional product.

            How can we begin such a daunting task?  One great strategy for turning complex problems into simpler ones
            is to see if we can first solve a simpler version of the problem.  We could start with some simple 3-dimensional
            shapes, such as a cube, pyramid, or tetrahedron, and figure out how to display those on our screen.  What we need
            for our use case above is a so-called "orthographic projection".  The simplest type of orthographic projection
            results from just "forgetting" one of the coordinates.  For example, the point (x, y) in two-dimensional space
            projects to the point x if we forget the last coordinate or y if we forget the first coordinate.  This is
            illustrated below.

            We need to be able to project to an arbitrary
            plane if we want to do the projection in a dynamic way.  To make things, even simpler, let's try to figure out how
            to project onto an arbitrary line or vector in two-dimensional space.  Again, we'll start with the easiest cases first.
        </p>
        <h2>Coordinate Projections of a vector</h2>
        <p>
            Let's denote the projection of the vector w onto the vector v by P<sub>v</sub> w.  Note that we can rescale v without
            affecting the result.
        </p>
        <p>
            Exercise.  Let v = (1, 0), w = (0, 1).  Compute P<sub>v</sub> w, P<sub>w</sub> v, P<sub>v</sub> v, and P<sub>w</sub> w.
        </p>
        <p>
            Exercise. Let u = (8, 7), v = (1, 0), and w = (0, 5).  Compute P<sub>v</sub> u and P<sub>w</sub> u.
        </p>
        <p>
            These cases illustrate projection by forgetting coordinates.  With that warmup, let's tackle the next most
            complicated case.  We've already seen how to project an arbirary vector to one like v = (1, 0).  Let's try to
            to reverse this and figure out how to project a vector like  v = (1, 0) in the direction of another arbitrary
            vector.
