		<h1>Understanding Mathematics</h1>
		<br/>
		<div id="main-text">
			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>
				When I was a student of mathematics, I had to struggle to find my own explanations of mathematical theories
				that I found satisfying on a conceptual level.  I would scour the libraries for books that had the explanations
				I was looking for, surf the internet, and wrack my own brain to come up with them myself. I found many mathematical
				authors and professors that I liked <!--- put book recommendations link here --> and some internet resources <!--- website recommendations -->,
				but I found that there was often a lot of work to be done on my part to find the explanations that I found really satisfying.
				I dreamed of one day creating an online resource where I could look up any topic I encountered and get the kind of explanation I was
				really looking for, freeing up future followers of my footsteps to travel a much easier path than I was able to.
			</p>
			<p>
				There were three things I was looking for: motivation, intuition, and applications.  I think my less mathematically advanced readers
				know what I mean by applications, but they might not know what I mean by the other two.  I'll make some comments on all three.
			</p>
			<br/>
			<h3>Motivation</h3>
			<p>
				When mathematicians talk about "motivation", they generally mean some sort of reason as to why a given topic might be interesting
				or useful.  For example, in introducing the concept of a square root of a number, we could justify introducing it by appealing to
				the example of finding the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle.  The key realization is that mathematics had to be
				invented by someone at some point, for a reason.  It turns out that this process of invention is sometimes a bit too complicated to follow in
				detail, particularly if you are not a specialist in the history of mathematics.  Furthermore, concepts often find many more applications than
				the ones that they were originally intended for, so mathematicians are often reluctant to tie themselves to these special cases.  Still,
				we should strive to at least give some examples and some idea of the kind of thing our definitions and theorems could be useful
				for.  It's standard for textbooks to give examples, but here we will take one step further than most and try to get to the point where we start to
				get the illusion that we could have invented the subject ourselves.  Another way to think of it is that instead of putting the theory first, and
				the problems only later, maybe we should start with the problems.  Armed with this sort of inspiration for the theory, rather than theory alone,
				it can be much easier to retain the knowledge we are working so hard to learn, and easier to apply it because we have a better idea of 
				the kinds of things it could be good for.  As a professor of mine <!--- link? --> once said, "I'm a mathematician, so I don't remember anything,
				I just remember how to derive it."  One word of caution is that sometimes this approach can be too ambitious.  There's so much to learn and so
				little time.  Of course, that's what this website is here for.
			</p>
			<br/>
			<h3>Intuition</h3>
			<p>
				Intuition, in the mathematical sense, refers to something a little bit more specific than in common
				usage.  It has a close relationship to the feeling that we know "why" something is true, as opposed
				to just carrying out a calculation, logical argument, or having to accept it on trust.  Visualization
				is a particularly powerful form of intuition.  To give a very elementary example, take the fact that
				(x + y) + z = x + (y + z), the associative property of addition.
			</p>
			<p>
				We can check that (2 + 3) + 7 = 5 + 7 = 12 and 2 + (3 + 7) = 2 + 10 = 12, so it doesn't matter
				which addition we do first.  We get the same answer either way.  But that's clear without carrying
				out the calculation.  If we put 2 apples and 3 apples together in a pile, and then add another 7 apples,
				then if we put the apples together in some other order, we get the same result.  This is
				is a very simple example of having "intuition" about why the fact that (2 + 3) + 7 = 2 + (3 + 7) is true,
				as opposed to checking by calculation.
			</p>
			<p>
				When mathematicians discover new mathematical facts, they may first have this sort of intuition about
				why they are true and only later figure out how to actually establish the facts through more formal
				calculations or logical arguments.
			</p>
			<p>
				Maybe the most profound thing about mathematical intuition is that it has a lot to do with why mathematicians
				enjoy their subject.  There is something special about having studied a subject for months and getting to the
				point where many facts that were initially puzzling are now completely obvious because you have developed an
				intuition for them.  So, all the popular distaste for math as a subject could plausibly be blamed on the fact
				that people are missing the all the intuition!
			</p>
			<p>
				If you are not a very visual person, to be honest, this website may not be for you.  However, we will try to follow
				the so-called "rule of four" and explain things numerical, algebraically, and verbally, as well as visually where
				applicable.  Some thought will be given towards giving clean arguments that rely a little bit less on the most strenous
				visualizations, while following similar lines.  In addition, pictures will be provided, so that you do not necessarily
				need to imagine things yourself.  Drawing your own pictures is highly encouraged as well.  Finally, even very
				visual thinkers will have to keep practicing the visualizations before they become clear, so it is totally normal for
				it to be difficult to see at first.  Keep running it through your mind until it becomes easy.  Some may wonder why
				we go through such lengths to visualize things when, in some cases, a calculation would be easier.  The simplest answer
				is that we do it because it is entertaining!  Some other reasons are that it will make things easier to remember, and it
				provides another source of inspiration for subsequent work.
			</p>
			<br/>
			<h3>Applications</h3>
			<p>
				Now, we come to what I consider the most difficult question for a lot of advanced mathematics.  When it comes to
				applications, I think of three different levels.  The first level is the sort that would answer the classic
				student's question "When will I ever use this?".  At that level, we seek applications that would be applicable to
				a career outside academic mathematics, so this type of application may fluctuate a lot with the job market.  At
				the second level, we still seek "real world" use cases, but now we try to identify cases where someone, somewhere
				makes use of it.  For example, today, most of the security of the internet depends on mathematical theories of cryptography.
				Finally, the third level of applications would be found mainly in academia, as practiced by applied mathematicians, or people
				in other departments, such as engineering, or physics.  Here, an application might be something like the singularity theorems
				that tell us something about the nature of black holes or a theorem that tells us of the existence and uniqueness of solutions
				for some differential equation that comes up in some branch of physics, like fluid mechanics.  It may not be terribly
				practical, despite being "an application".  There can also be applications that do help with practical things, but in
				sort of a round-about way that might be hard to explain or track down precisely.  For example, although there is a debate
				about the origins of the modern computer in the mathematical notion called a Universal Turing Machine, it is clear that Turing's
				theory gave us a better theoretical understanding of computing, and that, in turn, has some practical implications.
			</p>
			<p>
				I will do what I can for now to keep within arm's length of some kind of genuine applications, but in the
				future, I hope to find collaborators with more targeted experience with real world applications to help me with this.
			</p>

			<h3>A study tip</h3>
			<p>
				I will close my introduction by calling your attention to the concept of spaced repetition.  If you have not
				encountered it before, I highly recommend familiarizing yourself with it.

				Some may find it helpful to use tools like Anki that have been developed to help keep track of when it's time
				to review a concept.

			<p>
				I personally just developed a habit of constantly looking back into the past at intervals
				like one minute, one hour, one day, one month, one year, thinking what I had been learning at those points in time
				and reviewing, although it can be hard to keep up, and I have fallen off track at times.
